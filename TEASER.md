## Coding contest - coming soon

Add a teaser here!



The arena code is publicly available on [github](https://github.com/steemian/publicGood). Any comment/issue/pull request is most welcome. Minor changes and bugfixes may be added before the arena run

### The rewards

The arena will be executed in eight days, and the results published shortly after. All rewards from upvotes to this post and to my comments will be split between the winners:

1st player: 50% of total rewards
2nd player: 20%
3rd and 4th players: 10% each
10% are kept for myself

Of course, nothing prevents you from submitting an AI without upvoting to increase the prize pool. This is also part of the experiment. But given you have nothing to loose, it would be a bad move, wouldn't it?
