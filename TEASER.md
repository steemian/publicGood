## The AI Contest - Coming soon!

Here's a new project for Steem! Some fun for programmers and sociologists alike: AI contests. 

I provide a game, inspired by popular game theory case studies, and ask the Steem community to submit algorithms to play that game. Then rewards are split between the best performing AIs.

### Alright, but why?

You're on Steem, right? As you know life of the community depends on two things:

* Programmers
* Understanding people and how they react

*The AI Contest* is providing a fun way to mix those two ideas. You want to better understand how community reacts to a problem? You want to learn coding? Psychology? Just relax a little from the Steem bot you are writing? Just hop in the contest, it's free to get in and some cash will come at the end.

And you will help cognitive sciences!


### Why is that mess about games?

Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory): 

***Game theory** is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers*

In short, it's studying how people react to situations that look like a game, when they can win or loose from the situation, depending on other people' choices. It's both mathematics and psychology. You get addict. And it has lots and lots of applications in how people react to the blockchain technologies, no need to explain that to you steemains.

For a starter, go for the [prisonner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma)


### I heard contest. How does it work?

It's free to get in, and some prize money will be shared between winners. If you're a seasoned steemian you should be familiar with the concept. If not, then read about the magic of the Steem network [here](https://steemit.com/steem/@vinnu/what-is-steem-and-how-does-it-work)  or [here (more technical)](https://steemit.com/steem/@tuck-fheman/what-is-steem) or [here if you have time](https://steemit.com/steemy/@flauwy/60-steem-video-tutorials-for-beginners-the-grand-steemy-collection). 

*(many thanks to the authors I link to, including anonymous Wikipedians)*

More technically, 90% authoring rewards from contest posts (including this one, translations and comments) will be shared by contest winners. Contests should happen every week and payout should come shortly after.

The rules are simple: 
* give your answer to the contest as a comment. You may submit several answers. You can post code, alink to a [Gist](gist.github.com) or simply an English explanation
* upvote to add rewards to the pool (of course you don't *have to* but it wouldn't be fair) 
* after one week I will make your answers compete with one another
* ... and redistribute prizes


### Do I need to be a programmer

Yes. No. It's easier if you can post an answer that is written in Python. But I guess tere will be people around to help you translate an idea to Python. I will gladly do my share

The most important thing in playing a game is not writing the bot, it's being clever!

I chose Python. It's a good language: quick, compact and [easy to learn](python quick tutorial). Not one I'm very familiar with, but I'm learning.

**Plus**: this is a great way to learn programming. It's easy and it's a great asset for you!


### So where's the contest?

Tomorrow!

I will post the first contest tomorrow around noon CEST, with . Stay tuned!
