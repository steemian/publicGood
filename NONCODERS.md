# The Ai Contest #1 - Non-programmers welcome

### In short: you are welcome to the game
You want to enter the contest and you're not a programmer? No big deal. You can be smarter than programmers. Send your solution, we'll write the software for you (see below).

*At the time of writing, there is about 9 SBD in the prize pool, 90% shared between winners*

### Wait.. what game?
*(see the [full, detailed, and awesome original post](https://steemit.com/aicontest/@gbd/the-ai-contest-1-public-goods-problem))*

There is a contest running for an artificial intelligence. Players write bots that can play the [Common Goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goods_game) game. 

But this is *not* a coding contest. This is an *smartass* contest. Ideas compete, not code style.That's where you, steemians and not-steemians, can board in. *Should* board in. Read on.

### The Game

The ambiant is a common good. Anybody can pollute, anybody can clean a beach. Whatever everyone does, everybody benefits from a good ambiant and suffers from a bad one. It's best if someone makes an effort, even better if it's somebody else. The question is: should **You** participate in the global effort?

This is a trending problem, also coined [the Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons): when it comes only of the ambient lots of problems will arise in the years to come, and many real life problems are applications of the common goods dilemma. The fish remaining in the see. Who should wash the dishes. Soil overexploitation. State welfare.

***Will you help the community or shamelessly profit from it?***

### The Rules

Here comes the game. A very simple version where you bet virtual money

You describe an artificial intelligence. Not coding, just describing. There will be 15 players following *each* intelligence, plus a few stupid bots to fill the gaps.

All those players and bots will be split into tables of 10, and play 15 rounds. After 15 rounds, players will be shuffled again into tables 20 times. Shortly put, each player will play 300 rounds in total. All automated, of course.

Each round, players will have to give either **ten tokens** from their initial 100, if they want to contribute to common good, or **nothing** if they are selfish, or even **all they have**, for the greater good. Then, the bank *doubles* the total amount (to simulate that it's nicer to enjoy a nice beach than it is hard to clean it), and distribute the total to everybody, those who pollute and those who clean. Like in real life. 

The whole game is about understanding people when they are dealing with this type of problems. What is the winning strategy. Mathematics can't find it, only humans can. We have to think by ourselves.

Tell us how you would play this game, coders will implement it (it's fast and easy for them) and the competition will be held in 4 days.

All technical details will be found on the [original contest post](https://steemit.com/aicontest/@gbd/the-ai-contest-1-public-goods-problem)

### How to submit your solution

Just post a comment. As easy as that. Make it clear of course. Then programmers around will translate it and I will run the contest. A few examples?

```
My *ShamelessCopier* will systematically look for the richest other player on the table and copy its previous move. For the first move, it will bet ten as a token of good will to the others
```

```
scorpil's  *OffendablePlayer* if number of players that bet is less that number of players that don't * OFFENSIVENESS factor
```
